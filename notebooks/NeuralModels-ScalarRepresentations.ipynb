    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This document aims to present the global ideas of neural networks from the point of view of biological neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is once this basic knowledge is understood and starting from a Spiking Neural Network find possible ways of representing encodings in an Artificial Neural Network setup which does not rely in temporal spikes but in atemporal values instead to be used later to find alternative encoding posibilities for use as input in current **Artificial Neuron Network Model** (*ANNM*) technologies without the need to change the entire paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present document does not intend to be a complete guide to deeply understand neural coding, but as a high level overview of the encoding mechanism and how to encode a physical property into neural values linking resources for a deeper understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is inspired by the tuning curves of real neurons and the fact that an ensemble of neurons can represent an encoding of an input into a different vector space, being able to create a linear decoder that reconstructs the initial signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work presented here inspired mainly by the following books:\n",

    "## How neurons encode values\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to lie now, it is not a big lie but this is not a complete picture of what happens. Even if there is much (much) more to how a neuron works this description is enough for the present study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if there are [many neural representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model), the set of models that is enough to understand the general mechanics are the [Leaky Integrate and Fire Model](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S3.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify, a neuron can be in one of two states:\n",
    "1. firing\n",
    "2. not firing\n",
    "\n",
    "For a neuron to fire it needs to accumulate enough charge to pass a firing threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "This threshold is attained by accumulating charge that comes from spikes of neurons connected to the dentrites of the neuron in question (the one we are analyzing). \n",
    "The _leaky_ model means that it loses charge all the time, which means that it needs to be receiving more energy than the one it is losing to attain the firing threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a neuron fires it is called a spike, and after has a refractary period in which it can not fire while is charging again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of the current study of the neuron, what we care about more than if it fired or not is the firing frequency, which will represent a physical property in an encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see an example for a single neuron in the [Nengo documentation](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/v3.0.0/examples/basic/single-neuron.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another important point to be made: [brains are noisy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuronal_noise), there is a lot of noise and this implies that the brain has also mechanisms to cope with it."

    "### Human Eye Horizontal Position Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an example focusing on the encoding of the horizontal position of the eye. \n",
    "This organ and how it encodes values [has](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/146/1/195.full.pdf) [been](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.359620v1) [deeply](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6621321/) [studied](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193753) just to link a few studies on the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things that we could do to encode the position of an eye, let's start by what we can do in a robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a robot we can encode the camera (eye) horizontal position as a voltage value, which we can set between a minimum and a maximum. Let's say that our interval is [0,1] being 0 the outmost left and 1 the outmost right. this might be good for a circuit where this values can be interpreted directly, but in a noisy environment which encodes values in spikes this is not the best thing to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead what the brain does is use a set of neurons to represent a single scalar value. In this setup, each neuron has a firing rate which can be represented visually in what is called a \"Neural Tuning Curve\", this has also been studied in the [Primary Visual Cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex#Primary_visual_cortex_(V1)). \n",
    "You can see for example this study on [Sensory Coding](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040092).\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this case, what we have is a set of neurons each firing at a different rate, and covering a frequency spectrum that can later be decoded to a single scalar value. \n",
    "\n",
    "While there are [many](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00075/full) [publications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6705607/) on [encoding](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch11.S3.html) and  [decoding](https://pillowlab.princeton.edu/pubs/Yates20_JNPH.pdf) [mechanisms](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01848442/document), we can decode a value from a [neural ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuronal_ensemble) (a set of neurons representing a value or computation that we care about) with a [linear](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3864805/) [function](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199794546.001.0001/acprof-9780199794546) which might seem counter intuitive as the encoders (and what makes the neural computation powerful) are non-linear.\n",

    "1. deal with noise\n",
    "2. gracefully deal with failures (catastrophic failures are mostly avoided, unless a rock crushes the head)\n",

    "- In the brain an input scalar is represented by a **neural ensemble** of many neurons, each having a different _frequency firing response_ to different input values.\n",
    "- A **LIF (Leaky Integrate and Fire) Neuron** is a model that gets charge while there is input and continuously loses charge, if the input is stronger than the leak it will accumulate enough charge to pass the **firing threshold**, making the neuron fire\n",
    "- The graph showing the firing frequency response curves for all the neurons is the **Response Curve Graph**\n",
    "- The graph showing how the firing frequency of each neuron relates to the input value (for example the eye position) represents **Tuning Curves**\n",
    "- Most neurons are inactive or present low activity at a certain input value, this is a **Sparse Distributed Representation**\n",
    "- **Sparse Distributed Representation** allow for noise and failure resilient complex computations in a defined vector space.\n"
